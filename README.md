# Fake News Detection using LSTM

This project implements a **Deep Learning model** to classify news articles as **fake or real** using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network. 

The model predicts the probability of a news article being fake and achieves decent performance on validation data.

## Project Overview

Fake news can have significant social and political impacts. This project uses NLP and deep learning to classify news articles as fake or real. It leverages:

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal)  
- Tokenization & padding  
- Pre-trained GloVe embeddings for semantic understanding  
- LSTM neural network for sequential learning  

---

## Dataset

The dataset used is a CSV file containing the following columns:

- `id` : Unique identifier for each news article  
- `title` : Title of the news article  
- `author` : Author of the article  
- `text` : Full text of the news article  
- `label` : Target variable (`0` for real news, `1` for fake news)  

---

## Data Preprocessing

Steps applied to text data:

1. Clean data Format
2. Remove stopwords using NLTK 

Tokenization and padding:  

- Tokenizer fitted on the training data  
- Sequences padded/truncated to tokens

## Model Architecture

The model is a **Sequential LSTM network**:

- Embedding layer: Pre-trained GloVe embeddings
- LSTM: 128 units with dropout for regularization
- Dense layers: Fully connected layers for final prediction
- Output layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification

## Evaluation

- MSE (probabilities): 0.1809
- RMSE (probabilities): 0.4253
